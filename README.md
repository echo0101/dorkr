Where you go to dork your friends.

If you leave your comptuer unlocked around my friends, you'll likely found that someone's sent an "I'm a Dork!" email to everyone else. So I thought, wouldn't it be fun to see who's the dorkiest? This is a quick hack I put together which keeps track of dorks. Deploy this app to GAE and simply email the app's email address everytime you see an unlocked computer with the term "dork" in the subject line.
